# Elite Add On Helper
The aim of this is to create an application where you can define and launch addons and webpages when starting Elite.
This is currently a very early alpha version and should not be considered stable yet!
All options on the Non VR Tab are currently functional (Autodetect Paths, install and launch)
Autodetects looks for apps in their default locations, if you have change the install path, you will need to browse for them, with the exception of Steam Apps (Voiceattack and Elite) in this case, the program will search all local drives for a steamapps folder. If it doesnt find them, just use the browse button.

Dont forget to save preferences with the File - Save Prefs option!

To DO:
 Increase the amount of addons supported

 Add support for websites (Miner Tools, Spansh, Inara etc)

 Add a VR profile to enable launching different apps when in VR
